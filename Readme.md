# Responsive Data Table

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the implementation of a responsive data table using HTML and CSS. The table displays user information and adapts to different screen sizes for better accessibility and usability.

## Approach
- HTML Structure: A semantic table structure is used to display user data.
- CSS Styling: The CSS is designed to enhance the visual presentation of the table, ensuring readability and responsiveness.
- Responsiveness: Media queries are employed to adjust the table layout on smaller screens.

## Challenges
One of the challenges was ensuring the table remains readable on very small screens. This was addressed by using media queries to hide table headers and displaying data in a more mobile-friendly format.

## Code Explanation
- HTML: The main structure includes a table element with rows and cells containing user data.
- CSS: Styles are applied for visual enhancement, including background colors, padding, and responsive design.

## Conclusion
The solution effectively displays user information in a responsive table format, meeting the requirements of the project.
